          Deep Rock Galactic is a Co-Op extraction shooter that can be played with up to 3 other players. You play as one of the 4 dwarf classes (Gunner, Driller, Engineer and Scout)
          to complete a given objective. The missions take place in the caves of Hoxes and are procedurally generated with 100% destructible environments. Along with this are endless
          hordes of bugs trying to kill you. These rage from simple grunts to praetorians, oppressors and even dreadnaughts.

          Each class can choose between 3 primary, 3 secondary and 4 grenade options, each distincively different from one another. These weapons can be further custimized with
          various mods and overclocks. Each mission can take place in one of 12 biomes, each with their own hazards, way they generate and some with unique enemies. These can range
          from the Crystalline Caverns, to the massive open spaces of the Sandblasted Corridors, to the frigid Glacial Strata, to even the oddities of the Hollow Bough.
